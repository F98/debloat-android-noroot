The "I don't give a shit CoC".

I don't play the stupid virtue signaling game. 
I literally don't give a single shit who/what/where you are, as it is entirely irrelevent on this platform. 
Your political ideologies don't matter to me as it is not my business.
You can be racist or not racist and it doesn't matter the slightest to me. It is extremely immature to attack someone for thinking differently.
I believe anyone should be able to contribute to anything, including my stupid repos, as long as their code is good; their politics/life are not my business and I don't care.


This is the "I don't give a shit CoC". This is real equality and tolerance, buddy.
